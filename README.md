# CSCI181: Languages and Computing

## About the class

<img src=img/syllabus.png width=600px />

This class will cover stuff I think is fun about language.  For example:
1. various tricks/pitfalls for programming with LLMs,
1. formal language semantics (e.g. regular vs context free languages), and
1. differences between computer languages and natural languages.

Material will be posted in the github folder as we cover it.
1. I'll adjust the topics on-the-fly depending on what's "hot".
1. If you have anything that you'd like us to cover, let me know.

## Required background

You should able to code independently and figure out how to use random libraries.

The hardest thing for most people will probably be my use of git and the command line.

If Google doesn't solve your problems,
the QCL has lots of people who can help you with these problems.

The command line stuff might also be new to you.

Senior programmers have a (well-earned) reputation for being mean to juniors who ask dumb questions.

I promise not to be mean.
Please ask random questions about these tools throughout the semester!!!

## Grading

I'm treating this class like a graduate level seminar class.

Final project overview:
1. Do something cool vaguely related to what we talk about in class.
1. Create a github repo that explains your project.
1. Present it to me in person during finals week.

If you see a mistake in this repo anywhere,
please submit a pull request.
Your reward will be that I will respect you.

## Collaboration Policy

Do whatever you want if it helps you learn.
But be an adult and don't do anything stupid.
